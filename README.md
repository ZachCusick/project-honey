# Project Honey

###Motivation:
We want to focus on making a honeypot because we want to set some up on our own networks to see if any hackers are trying to get information about our networks or break in somehow. I think it would be interesting to detect internet bots scraping the web and see where they come from based on IP.

###Problem Statement:
We are going to design a honeypot to detect malicious actors spying on a network. The challenges we face are protecting a network from hackers looking for vulnerabilities. 

###The plan:
We will create a honeypot most likely in Python that will mimic real network services. Some services we will probably recreate are HTTP, FTP, SSH, and SMTP.
